# The goose that laid the golden eggs

Once upon a time there was a couple of farmers who, one day, discovered in one of the nests where they were raising chickens a solid golden egg. The couple observed that the bird produced such a prodigy day after day, obtaining a golden egg every day.



Nonne vides quid sit? Tu es ... Jesse me respice. Tu ... blowfish sunt. A blowfish! Cogitare. Statura pusillus, nec sapientium panem, nec artificum. Sed predators facile pr√¶dam blowfish secretum telum non se habet. Non ille? Quid faciam blowfish, Isai. Blowfish quid faciat? In blowfish inflat, purus?

The thing is that they did peanut with those eggs, mainly because they were too busy eating it, yeah...I know. 
Aaaaaand this how the expression is born ( well, from my point of view): having a goose with golden eggs leads to nothing if you don't know how to use it. Same with money when you have it : you can have it has much as you want but if you don't know how to use it, there is no plus value.
