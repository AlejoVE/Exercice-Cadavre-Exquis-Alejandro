# The goose that laid the golden eggs

Once upon a time there was a couple of farmers who, one day, discovered in one of the nests where they were raising chickens a solid golden egg. The couple observed that the bird produced such a prodigy day after day, obtaining a golden egg every day.

The greedy man took the chicken with the golden eggs and abandoned his wife.
